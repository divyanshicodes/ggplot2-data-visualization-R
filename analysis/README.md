# Data Visualization Using ggplot2

This project demonstrates essential data visualization techniques in R using the ggplot2 package. The analysis uses the `mpg` dataset and covers exploratory visualizations such as histograms, density plots, bar charts, boxplots, violin plots, and scatter plots.

### 🔍 Key Steps
• Loading and inspecting the mpg dataset  
• Checking and converting data types  
• Examining categorical distributions  
• Visualizing fuel efficiency and car classes  
• Working with city vs highway MPG  
• Creating layered plots with ggplot2  

### 📊 Visualizations Created
• Histogram of city MPG  
• Density plot  
• Bar chart by car class  
• Bar chart by class filled by cylinder count  
• Boxplot of city MPG vs class  
• Violin plot  
• Scatter plot of city MPG vs highway MPG  
• Scatter plot with color-coded classes  
• Scatter plot with point size representing cylinders  
• Count plot for class vs number of cylinders  

### 🧰 Tools Used
• RStudio  
• ggplot2  

### 🎯 Goal
To practice building meaningful visualizations using ggplot2 and improve understanding of car fuel efficiency relationships within the mpg dataset.
