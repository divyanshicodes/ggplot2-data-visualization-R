# Problem Overview

This project explores visual patterns in vehicle fuel efficiency using the `mpg` dataset. The goal is to create histograms, density plots, bar charts, boxplots, violin plots, scatter plots, and count plots using ggplot2.

## Objectives
• Inspect data structure and convert appropriate columns to factors  
• Summarize distributions of vehicle classes and manufacturers  
• Visualize city and highway MPG patterns  
• Compare MPG across car classes  
• Explore relationships using scatter plots with color and size encoding  
• Create a count plot of class vs cylinder categories  

## Focus
To build meaningful visualizations using ggplot2 and understand fuel efficiency, car types, and MPG relationships.
